Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: bb15a9e781007834.vercel-dns-017.com
TTL: 60
```

## How to Add the DNS Record

### Option 1: Through Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/account/domains/tryquotely.com
2. Click "DNS" or "DNS Records"
3. Add new record:
   - Type: **CNAME**
   - Name: **www**
   - Value: **bb15a9e781007834.vercel-dns-017.com**
   - TTL: **60**
4. Save changes

### Option 2: Through Your Domain Provider
If your domain is managed elsewhere (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.):
1. Login to your domain provider
2. Find DNS Management
3. Add the CNAME record above
4. Save changes

## Also Remove the Typo Domain
In your Vercel project settings, remove:
- www.tryqoutely.com (typo with 'ou' instead of 'uo')

## After Update
- Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS propagation
- Both URLs will work:
  - https://tryquotely.com ‚úÖ
  - https://www.tryquotely.com ‚úÖ

## Important Note
Vercel has updated their DNS infrastructure. The new record format is:
- **New format:** bb15a9e781007834.vercel-dns-017.com
- **Old format:** cname.vercel-dns.com (still works but deprecated)

Use the new format for best performance!
