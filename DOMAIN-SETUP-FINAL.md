# ✅ Domain Setup Final Steps

## Current Status

- ✅ www.tryquotely.com subdomain verified  
- ✅ Site deployed to: https://quotely-spa-one.vercel.app
- ⚠️ Domain not connected to project

## Final Step Required

### Manual Connection in Vercel Dashboard

1. **Go to your Vercel dashboard:**
   https://vercel.com/quotelys-projects-93b374b6/quotely-spa/settings/domains

2. **Click "Add Domain"**

3. **Enter:** tryquotely.com

4. **Click "Add"**

5. **It should automatically connect** since the domain is already verified in your account

## Alternative: If Above Doesn't Work

Since the domain shows as verified but can't be added via CLI, you may need to:

1. **Go to:** https://vercel.com/account/domains
2. **Find tryquotely.com**  
3. **Click on it**
4. **Assign it to the "quotely-spa" project**

## Test Your Live Site

Once connected, your site will be live at:
- https://tryquotely.com
- https://www.tryquotely.com

## DNS Records Status
✅ All DNS records are properly configured:
- A record: 216.198.79.1 (pointing to Vercel)
- TXT verification for tryquotely.com
- TXT verification for www.tryquotely.com
- ALIAS records pointing to cname.vercel-dns-016.com

## Your Site Is Ready!
