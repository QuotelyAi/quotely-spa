# ðŸŽ‰ DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL!

## Your Site is LIVE at ALL URLs:

âœ… **https://tryquotely.com** - Working!  
âœ… **https://www.tryquotely.com** - Working!  
âœ… **https://quotely-spa-one.vercel.app** - Working!

## DNS Configuration Complete

### Successfully configured:
- âœ… Root domain A record pointing to Vercel (216.198.79.1)
- âœ… WWW CNAME record pointing to Vercel (bb15a9e781007834.vercel-dns-017.com)
- âœ… Domain verification TXT records
- âœ… SSL certificates active on all domains

## What's Live:

Your Quotely insurance platform with:
- Token-based pricing ($999/month core + token packages)
- Purple/Orange/Yellow color scheme as requested
- All truthful content (no false claims)
- Working calculator, pricing, and comparison pages
- Atlas Otto search integration (Cmd+K)

## Remaining Task:

Remove the typo domain "www.tryqoutely.com" from your Vercel project settings when you get a chance (it won't affect the live sites).

## Share These URLs:

You can now share any of these URLs:
- **Primary:** https://tryquotely.com
- **With www:** https://www.tryquotely.com  
- **Vercel URL:** https://quotely-spa-one.vercel.app

All three URLs show the exact same site and are fully functional!

**Congratulations! Your Quotely platform is live and ready for business!** ðŸš€
